# Ten_Commandments_Nes
The Ten Commandments on your Nes

The Bottom line of text will not display on the screen when loading the code as it barely fits the NES Screen. 

I have not tested this on a real console.  

Build with the 8bitworkshop IDE

The Rom image can be edited with any Hex Editor.

The Text is not compressed and does not need a Table file.
