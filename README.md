# Ten_Commandments_Nes
The Ten Commandments on your Nes

The Bottom line of text will not display on the screen when loading the code as it barely fits the NES Screen in Emulators. 

I have not tested this on a real console.  

Build with the 8bitworkshop IDE

The Rom image can be edited with any Hex Editor.

The Text is not compressed and does not need a Table file.
